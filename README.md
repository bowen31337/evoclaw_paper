## ✨ Key Features

- **🧬 Autonomous Mutation Engine**: Agents capable of self-modifying their logic based on environment feedback.
- **☁️ Distributed Infrastructure**: Seamless coordination across Raspberry Pi clusters and cloud servers.
- **📊 Real-time Analytics**: Dynamic visualization of mutation success rates and evolution progress.
- **⚡ High Performance**: Built with modern web technologies for a smooth, immersive experience.
- **🛡️ Secure Evolution**: Sandboxed execution environments for safe code mutation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Visuals**: Chart.js, Custom CSS Animations
- **Icons**: Material Symbols, Font Awesome
- **Fonts**: JetBrains Mono, Inter
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions + Cloudflare Pages

## 🚀 How It Works

EVOCLAW agents utilize a **G-C-A-T** (Generation, Coordination, Adaptation, Testing) loop:
1. **Generation**: New code snippets are generated based on performance needs.
2. **Coordination**: Changes are synchronized across the agent network.
3. **Adaptation**: Successful mutations are integrated into the core DNA.
4. **Testing**: Continuous validation ensures system stability.

## 📦 Deployment & Development

This repository is set up for **Continuous Deployment**.

### To Update:
1. Edit `index.html`
2. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "feat: enhance evolution visualization"
   ```
3. Push to main:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

The **GitHub Action** will automatically rebuild and deploy the site to Cloudflare Pages.
